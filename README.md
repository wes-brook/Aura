# Future Plans
Basically, I created this as a template for future full-stack projects. For this particular project, I plan to add more features and polish the UI/UX as I learn more about relevant web technologies that I find useful. In the near future, I'll be adding TailWind to this project to make it look like it wasn't made 20 years ago.
